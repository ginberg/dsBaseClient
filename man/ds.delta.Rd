\title{Calculates the difference between rows for a target column in grouped data}
\usage{
ds.delta(input = NULL, id_col = NULL, target_col = NULL, newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{a character, the name of the data frame to process}

\item{id_col}{a character, the name of the field in the data frame that groups
the data}

\item{target_col}{a character, the name of the field in the data frame}

\item{newobj}{a character, the name of the new vector in which values have been shifted
If no name is specified the default name is the name of the original vector followed by the suffix
'.delta' e.g. 'LAB_HDL.delta' if the name of the vector is 'LAB_HDL'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a new vector containing the deltas
}
\description{
This function calculates the difference between rows for a target
column in grouped data. For non-grouped data it would be possible to use rowShift
}
\details{
This function is used when the analyst needs to calculate the difference
between rows for a column. The data should be grouped by an identifying column:
 for non-grouped data it is possible to use the rowShift function and a subtraction
 to perform the same operation
